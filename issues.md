# How To Write A Good Issue

This is a short guide to help folks write good issues when using Github's issue system.  This will tackle specifically the tool GH provides.  For more general info on how to write a good bug report, check out Mike Hay's [blog post][1] about it.


Like any other bug/issue tracking system, understand how to best communicate what you need is critical to the developer on the receiving end of an issue.

Three things go into writing a good issue:

 - Writing a good simple title
 - Categorizing it correctly (task, enhancement or bug)
 - Describing it simply enough.
