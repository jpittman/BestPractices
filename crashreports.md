# What to do when something crashes

While the examples I'll use will generally be related to iOS apps and what to do when they crash, these steps can be applied generally to any piece of software someone is working on.

### Opps, a Crash

When you get a crash, please do the following:

 - Write down the steps you took inside the app to get to the crash.  Be as concise as possible.
 - If you can, try to reproduce the crash to help clarify or simplify the steps previously written.
 - File an issue, bug or email those steps to the developer.
 - If the app you're testing is using some form of crash reporting software, please make sure to use it to submit your crash into the system.
