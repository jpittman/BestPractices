It's important to communicate changes to a user when you are shipping a build out to this.  The text below the line in this document is to serve as a guide (or a template if needed) for what a developer should be including in a "new build" email/message.

---

This is a high level description of what's new in the build.  Take a moment to highlight and generalize anything critical for the person reading this message to look at.

## Build Details:

This build includes the following:

 - This should be an itemized list of changes in the build.
 - It should cover new features (or additions to features) first
 - It should also include bug fixes (with issue numbers associated) as well.  
 - One issue per line.

### Known Issues:

 - This should be a list of known issues (and bugs) in the build you're shipping.
 - It should be a break down of one issue per line and include issue numbers associated.
 - The testing user should be able to refer to this line to determine whether a bug is a known issue.

## Testing Instructions:

Here you should any additional instructions for testing out the app or service.  If necessary, include a list breaking down the steps for the user to log in as a specific user or how to access a particular feature.

## Reporting Issues:

This is where any additional instructions or a link to issue reporting documentation should be included.  At a minimum, just include the line below to make sure that it's clear that any issue needs to be reported.

Please send design issues, bugs and questions you have.
